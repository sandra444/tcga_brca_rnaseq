    "### What are the differentially expressed genes between HER2 positive and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)?\n",
    "Breast cancer is a classic example of the use of precision treatment. Patients with cancerous cells that express the estrogen receptor (ER+) receive hormone therapy and a recent [report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29860917?dopt=Abstract) demonstrates that a subset of those patients based entirely on gene expression do not benefit from chemotherapy. Likewise, patients with cancerous cells with amplified ERBB2 (HER2) are treated with a targeted therapy that has dramatically improved the prognosis of those patients. However, patients with breast cancer cells that do not express ER, HER2, or the progesteron receptor (PR) have what is known as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). There are currently no targeted therapies for TNBC breast cancer. One might be interested in what genes are expressed differently in HER2+ vs. TNBC given that HER2+ are typically also ER and PR negative. We will ask that question using the TCGA counts data. \n",

    "## Our pipeline\n",
    "In the pipeline image, the red text indicates the names of the R packages we will use to perform the analysis, the yellow boxes indicate the data (raw or processed), and the grey indicates what we will do in each step. Note that we will use [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). This is a highly cited package that uses a negative binomial distribution to calculate DEGs. However, there are multiple pipelines and programs to do this. [Knoweng](http://education.knoweng.org/sequenceng/) has a nice interface to explore other options, including the strengths and weaknesses of each.\n",

    "### Where are HER2 and TNBC statuses?\n",
    "To determine TNBC we need to know if each tumor is positive or negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2. ER is determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and is directly reported for all patients under \"breast_carcinoma_estrogen_receptor_status.\" PR is determined by immunohistochemistry and is directly reported for all patients under \"breast_carcinoma_progesterone_receptor_status.\" However, HER2 is not directly reported for each patient. Instead, HER2 is determined clinically by two different tests (IHC and in situ hybridization) that are reported (if available) under \"lab_proc_her2_neu_immunohistochemistry_receptor_status\" and \"lab_procedure_her2_neu_in_situ_hybrid_outcome_type.\" Often IHC is performed first and if an indeterminable result is obtained then in situ hybridization is performed. However, if you examine the data closely you will notice that in some instances IHC and in situ hybridization will be discordant. We will throw out those samples for our analysis as we cannot properly determine HER2 status. Otherwise if one of the two tests has a \"positive\" or \"negative\" result and the other test is NA or indeterminable, we will use the single test result. \n",
    "\n",
    "The clinical data above has more data than we are interested in, which can make it a bit more difficult to work with. Run the code below to select only the columns that we need to determine HER2 and TNBC status. These are the columns that provide information on ER, PR, and HER2. "

    "Find information about .gtf files [here](https://www.gencodegenes.org/pages/faq.html). These annotation files contain all of the information about the transcriptome structure. The first column is the chromosome location. The second is the annotation source of the gene, transcript, or exon. The 3rd column indicates if the structure being described is a gene, transcript, or exon (more on this below). The 4th and 5th are the start and stop stop respectively. The 7th column indicates which strand the transcript is on. Finally, the 9th column is a semicolon seperated group of nomenclature including the Ensembl gene and transcript ID. \n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the third column, note the structure from row to row. Information about a gene is first given (see line 1 from the output above for gene ENSG00000223972) including the start and stop position of the entire gene, but ignores transcript and exon/intron structure. The next row (see line 2 from above; transcript ENST00000456328 of gene ENSG00000223972) will then be the first transcript of the preceeding gene again with the start and stop positions as well as the IDs for each, again while ignoring the exon/intron structure. However, the next set of rows will describe the exon/intron structure. In the above example rows 3, 4, and 5 indicate the 3 exons making up the first transcript (ENST00000456328). After that structure is complete the next line indicates the second transcript (ENST00000450305) of the gene (ENSG00000223972). We are interested in creating a table with two columns- transcript and gene. So, we will start by extracting all transcripts. We can do this by by extracting all rows with the third column == to transcript.\n"
